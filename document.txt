Something I should know about Django development:

1. Check the version of Django ( immediately after downloading ):

        import django
        print( django.get_version() )

    => It should print the version out as below:

        4.0.6

2. Start a new project:

        python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8088

        ( general form: python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:<port_num> )

    => It should start a new page on http://127.0.0.1:8088
    => The port_num is not fixed.

3. Add a new application to project:

        python3 manage.py startapp app_example

        ( general form: python3 manage.py startapp <app_name> )

    => A new sub-directory should be added automatically named <app_name>, and it should contain all the following data:
        => admin.py
        => apps.py
        => models.py
        => tests.py
        => views.py

    => You should manually add a some new content in settings.py:
        => There should be a list named INSTALLED_APPS.
        => Add '<app_name>.apps.<ConfigClassName>'

4. Using sqlite database:

    => create your database model in <proj>/<app>/models.py

    => make migration:

        python3 manage.py makemigration

        => Attention: Do not use the following command:

            python3 manage.py makemigration <app>

        It will result in an error.
